UK Solar and Battery Aggregator Social Energy Raises Cash, Plans Expansion
",1/28/2021,"[""U.K. residential energy aggregator Social Energy is planning international expansion after gaining multimillion-dollar backing from U.S. alternative investment manager CarVal Investors.\xa0The parties have not disclosed the amount involved beyond saying it represents “a significant investment.”\xa0Minneapolis-based CarVal Investors bought into Social Energy in December last year, the energy company said in a press release. As a result of the deal, London-based CarVal Investors principal Stuart Lammin will be joining the Social Energy board.\xa0Seven-year-old Social Energy specializes in offering low-cost energy to residential customers. It sells solar and Duracell home battery systems, and then aggregates their output using an artificial intelligence-based metering system called the Social Energy Hub.\xa0As well as providing round-the-clock power for its customers, Social Energy uses the aggregated capacity to offer services such as demand response and frequency response to U.K. electricity system operator National Grid ESO, as well as offering\xa0flexibility services to distribution system operators such as U.K. Power Networks.\xa0About 70 percent of the revenue from these services is split among\xa0Social Energy’s customers, allowing the energy company to offer a faster payback than residential solar and battery owners would get with a standard self-consumption model.\xa0In the U.K., Social Energy claims it can help residential customers save an average of\xa0£226 ($310) a year. The company now has 6,300 U.K. customers,\xa0Daniel Mahoney, Social Energy’s marketing director, told GTM in an interview.\xa0\xa0Famous faces fronting the brand\n\nPrior to the current fundraising round, the business had brought in £12 million ($16.5 million) from high-net-worth individuals, he said.\xa0These include two sports celebrities from the world of cricket: Michael Vaughan and Shane Warne, who formerly captained the England and Australian national teams, respectively. Warne invested in Social Energy in 2019 and helped launch the business in Australia last November.\xa0Mahoney said Social Energy is looking for significant growth in\xa0the Australian market\xa0because of the\xa0prevalence of residential solar and battery storage in that country. “We’ve already seen a really strong uptake over there,” said Mahoney, without providing figures.\xa0The U.K. averages between 1,500 and 2,000 residential solar system installations a month, he said, “whereas Australia has been peaking at 24,000 a month, so it really is a 10x larger market.”The market for retrofitting batteries to existing residential solar systems is also much larger in Australia than in the U.K., Mahoney said. There are around 3 million residential solar systems without batteries in Australia, compared to 1 million in the U.K., he claimed.\xa0Finally, Social Energy expects to be able to offer its Australian customers much greater savings. The company said in\xa0a tweet\xa0that it could save AUD $2,182 (USD $1,679) a year on energy bills, based on its U.K. business model of selling services to the grid operator.\xa0“In Australia, we can take those complex earnings and translate that into the feed-in tariff,” said Mahoney. “We’re paying feed-in tariffs of 40 cents [USD $0.31] per kilowatt-hour, compared to a market average of 10 cents [USD $0.08].”Entering\xa0new markets and delivering new products\n\nExpansion into the Australian market will be partly funded by the CarVal Investors cash injection.

A Defunct Energy Hardware Startup Is Reborn as Software-Centric Axiom Cloud
",1/27/2021,"['Clean-energy entrepreneurs sometimes bemoan Silicon Valley\'s preference for funding software startups instead of the tough tech needed to tackle problems like climate change and crumbling infrastructure. But sometimes software really does the trick.Amrit Robbins found that out the hard way. The Stanford alum founded and led Axiom Exergy, an East Bay startup that raised at least $12.5 million\xa0to equip\xa0grocery stores with thermal batteries. Those devices use electricity to precool so they can take over refrigeration duties\xa0during hours when electricity gets more expensive, saving money for the store.If a power outage hits, thermal storage can keep\xa0food cool for several hours, preventing food spoilage. It was a specific instance of a central theme in the clean energy industry:\xa0helping a paying customer while making the broader grid system cleaner and more efficient.That company shut down last year after five years, hit by the upheavals of 2020 and the realization that the hardware business wasn\'t going to scale. But Robbins managed to rally his employees, buy back the intellectual property\xa0and relaunch as Axiom Cloud.The new startup delivers most of the benefits of the predecessor, but with a pure software product that operates existing refrigeration systems more efficiently.""We’re able to deliver [return on investment] that’s spectacularly better,"" Robbins told Greentech Media this week.\xa0On Tuesday,\xa0Axiom Cloud revealed\xa0a $1.1 million seed round led by Ulu Ventures and joined by Powerhouse Ventures, Lorimer Ventures and Correlation Ventures. The software is already live in dozens of grocery stores, including Whole Foods locations and three other major grocery chains in the U.S. and Canada, Robbins said.\n\nThe newly raised funds will go to delivering the service to hundreds of stores by the end of the year, he added.Hard times for hardwareAxiom Exergy needed a bridge round of funding in early 2020. By March, the extent of the COVID-19 crisis was becoming apparent. Plummeting oil prices forced spending cutbacks for energy companies such as\xa0Shell, which had been a major investor.\xa0On top of those new challenges, Axiom\'s hardware business was proving more difficult to scale than it sounded on paper.""We just weren’t moving as quickly as we had hoped was going to be possible,"" Robbins said.Axiom Exergy tried to pivot to software late in the game, but it was structurally committed to the hardware play. Major backers including\xa0Shell and Evergy Ventures based their commitments on the risk profiles and returns of a hardware company, not a software company. The startup had committed to research and development\xa0investments, equipment purchases and even insurance products needed for adapting thermal storage tanks to interface with commercial refrigeration machinery. Those once-necessary investments weighed down the enterprise, complicating a switch to software as the primary business.""We tried everything we possibly could to keep it alive, but there just wasn’t a clear path forward,"" Robbins said.Robbins shut down the company\xa0in June. But he and the team thought there was still potential in the software they had developed to accompany the thermal batteries. Instead of using a tank of saline solution to store energy, a grocery store can use software to precool its\xa0freezers to dodge utility demand charges. Axiom Exergy had also been working on a preventive maintenance product using artificial intelligence\xa0to flag refrigeration performance issues that could be precursors to\xa0costly equipment breakdowns.\n\nThe Axiom alums decided to rally around those software capabilities with a new company, dubbed Axiom Cloud. They bought back their old intellectual property and customer relationships\xa0from Turntide Technologies, an electric motor company that acquired them after Axiom Exergy shut down.

Schneider Electric Unveils the Energy Center for Distributed-Energy-Enabled Homes
",1/11/2021,"[""Homes need a lot more digital smarts nowadays to manage rooftop solar, backup batteries and electric vehicle chargers. It’s nice if those distributed energy resources (DERs) can be integrated with household electrical load controls via smartphone or Alexa or Google voice-activated devices.\xa0Then there’s the need to optimize these DERs and loads against utility time-of-use rates, net-metering tariffs and\xa0EV charging rate structures. And in worst-case scenarios, homeowners want to keep critical loads powered via battery or backup generator\xa0during outages that can last for hours or days at a time.\xa0This mix of future-forward list of home energy control capabilities is increasingly in demand in markets including California, the epicenter of both DER deployment and wildfire-prevention grid outages. And while mass-market home electrical equipment tends to be optimized for low cost and reliability, both startups and global vendors alike are starting to see an opportunity to upsell contractors and homeowners on integrated systems that can take on all of these tasks at once.\xa0The most recent example is\xa0Schneider Electric’s latest Square D Energy Center, which is being unveiled at this week’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. Set to be available in mid-2021, it combines the features of what would normally be six or seven separate equipment installations into one electrical service entrance box, integrated via Schneider’s Wiser energy control platform.\xa0This is far from the first entry into “smart home” technology for Schneider Electric, whose Square D electrical distribution equipment brand holds significant market share in the residential and commercial building markets. Wiser has been around\xa0for nearly a decade, entering homes both\xa0through utility programs\xa0and via partnerships with home automation providers\xa0like Alarm.com.\xa0But the latest product may be better poised for mass-market adoption than the previous iterations of smart home systems that have largely remained the stuff of CES showrooms and ultra-wealthy homeowner installations for the past decade or more.\xa0The building blocks of the smart, distributed energy-enabled homeOne key driver in this new market paradigm is the massive success of voice-activated devices, namely the\xa0Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, which Wood Mackenzie predicts will be the go-to platform for home energy control integration over the next decade.\n\nAll of the top\xa0homebuilders in the U.S. are including these systems more or less as a matter of course nowadays,\xa0Richard\xa0Korthauer, vice president of Schneider’s home and distribution business, said in an interview. “This is something that’s allowing Schneider to launch into the whole connected environment.”\xa0Another shift is the rising demand for rooftop solar systems equipped with batteries, both to shift solar-generated energy to more valuable times of the day and to provide emergency backup power, he said.\xa0These installations often require replacing older electrical panels anyway, giving contractors and homeowners a reason to spend extra money on newer technology that can skip the need for costly extra equipment and hours of work from licensed electricians.\xa0\xa0In particular, the system is configured to allow wiring-free installation of the popular\xa0SolarEdge solar inverter\xa0system — “It’s literally taking the unit, putting it on a hanger and plugging it in.”\xa0The interior of Schneider Electric's new integrated electrical panel. (Credit: Schneider Electric)Giving customers the ability to pick critical and noncritical loads to power during outages on the fly also increases flexibility and reduces costs involved in setting up systems to provide backup power, such as installing switches for preselected\xa0hard-wired loads.\xa0\xa0\n\nWhat’s more, Schneider’s platform integrates energy\xa0disaggregation from Sense, which can differentiate household loads down to the individual appliance. That allows the Square D Energy Center to measure energy use against home solar generation and stored battery power,\xa0and to know how long they can keep certain loads running depending on how long the outage is expected to last.\xa0“If you’re a homeowner\xa0and you have to deal with planned blackouts, this is a real enabler — first of all to pick your alternative energy source,\xa0and then to let our system match the power requirements you need,”\xa0Korthauer said.\xa0Energy disaggregation comes in many different flavors with different levels of granularity and does require some time to learn the signatures of different household loads to deliver accurate and reliable data. But two years after investing in and launching a\xa0strategic partnership with Sense, Schneider has figured\xa0it out.“I’ve had it installed in my home, and in a matter of weeks, I had my heating and air conditioning [in the system]. I had my critical energy loads [figured out] pretty quickly,\xa0and I also understood my random loads,” he said.\xa0Electric vehicles add another important load to manage, with charging that can add up to a third to a half of a typical home’s electricity demand.\xa0Increasing competition in-home energy controlsThe same drivers have pushed a host of technology providers to take the leap into more expensive products that could promise to save money compared to traditional “dumb” electronic equipment over the long haul.\xa0\xa0Many different solar and storage vendors, including\xa0Tesla,\xa0Sunrun,\xa0sonnen,\xa0Generac\xa0and\xa0Enphase, are offering energy control platforms that are adding sophistication to manage time-of-use rates and visibility into demand-supply balance during blackouts. Some are integrating energy disaggregation, as with Generac’s acquisition of Vancouver, Canada-based startup Neurio last year.\xa0Startup Lumin makes hardware that integrates into electrical panels and software to give homeowners\xa0visibility into and control\xa0over battery power supply and household load demand, and it\xa0is being used by numerous solar and storage installers.\xa0Span, a San Francisco-based startup founded by Tesla alum Arch Rao, makes a\xa0smart home electrical panel\xa0that offers smartphone monitoring control over critical and noncritical loads, as well as machine learning to manage rooftop solar and battery supply against household demand. It’s partnering with\xa0battery supplier LG Chem\xa0and solar installers in Hawaii and California.\xa0Eaton, one of Schneider’s primary global competitors in the distribution electronics field, has been testing\xa0cloud-connected circuit breakers\xa0in field trials with the Electric Power Research Association\xa0for the past few years, and has integrated them into commercially available products such as sonnen’s EcoLinx home automation platform.\xa0All of this increased capability comes at a price, of course. But while Schneider hasn’t released pricing details on the Square D Energy Center, Korthauer said its upfront cost will be well below the cost of putting together its range of functionalities by integrating separate technologies.“You’re going to pick up the ability to do distributed energy, energy monitoring via the Wiser app [and]\xa0the ability to automatically switch loads, and you’re going to be adding literally only $1,000 to your initial investment,” he said.\xa0"", 'Then there’s the need to optimize these DERs and loads against utility time-of-use rates, net-metering tariffs and\xa0EV charging rate structures. And in worst-case scenarios, homeowners want to keep critical loads powered via battery or backup generator\xa0during outages that can last for hours or days at a time.\xa0', 'This mix of future-forward list of home energy control capabilities is increasingly in demand in markets including California, the epicenter of both DER deployment and wildfire-prevention grid outages.

5 Startups Working to End Utility-Caused Wildfires
",12/10/2020,"['Utilities are not solely responsible for the wildfires that have ravaged the United States in recent years, but they are responsible for some of the most deadly and destructive fires seen to date.The most notable example is the November 2018 Camp fire in California, caused by a poorly maintained Pacific Gas & Electric power line that ultimately led to the deaths of at least 85 people. Facing billions of dollars in liabilities, PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2019, emerging earlier this year with billions of dollars in debt. Last month, the utility brought on a new CEO in seeking to restore public confidence in its ability to safely operate its Northern California grid.PG&E and other California utilities have sought to improve grid hardening, vegetation clearing\xa0and system monitoring under pressure from state policymakers. But the work is slow and imprecise. In the meantime, utilities have attempted to reduce the risk of sparking wildfires through heavily criticized\xa0""public-safety power shutoff"" events.California regulators recently approved wildfire mitigation plans for the state’s three large investor-owned utilities, as well as several smaller electricity providers. PG&E, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric are expected to collectively spend more than $15 billion to reduce the threat of wildfires caused by their power grids through 2022. California utilities say they’re looking to state-of-the-art technologies and techniques to help in this effort.Some of the advanced technologies that will help utilities mitigate fire risks are still in the early stages of development and commercialization. Finding financing for these solutions can be a challenge for entrepreneurs. But that may be shifting as utilities, governments and the broader public come to understand the cost of inaction.To help California mitigate its ever-growing wildfires, California Sustainable Energy Entrepreneur Development (CalSEED) program, in collaboration with the California Energy Commission (CEC) and accelerator New Energy Nexus, recently selected 28 startups to receive grants of $150,000 each, including five companies focused specifically on protecting the power grid from wildfires and mitigating public-safety power shutoff events. The program aims to bring new players into this high-stakes space.“Through the [Electric Program Investment Charge] program, the CEC partners with CalSEED in supporting California’s leading entrepreneurs with the resources they need to develop and advance clean energy innovations, including technologies that will help build wildfire resilience into the grid,” CEC Vice Chair Janea Scott told Greentech Media. “With over 4 million acres burned and more than 10,000 structures destroyed or damaged this season alone, advances in both wildfire science and\xa0technologies that can increase resilience or help harden the grid against the impacts of climate change are becoming even more critical for the health and safety of all Californians.”\n\nHere’s a look at five startups California is looking to for solutions to utility-caused wildfires.GridwareTimothy Barat worked on\xa0a line crew and as an electrician before co-founding Gridware, which uses sensors and software to provide\xa0grid monitoring for the power distribution grid. Having worked in the field, Barat is familiar with the drawbacks of traditional utility grid monitoring and maintenance practices, which he says can overlook weaknesses in the system that lead to wildfires.Gridware’s solution centers on deploying a network of low-cost sensors to monitor poles, conductors and other equipment on the distribution grid. Through the combination of remote sensors and risk simulation software, Gridware can give utilities situational awareness across their system, alert them to faults in real time and predict where malfunctions might occur in the future. The early warning system enables utilities to respond to irregularities before they become failures. Gridware’s solution also operates independently of the grid to ensure that it will continue to function during a power outage.“Wildfires are caused because of aging infrastructure and the manual inspection process,” said Barat. “If a line or power pole comes down or a cross-line fails, a lot of utilities might not know until someone in the public notices. And these are things that can start fires. If we can detect all of these issues, there is a future where utilities don’t start fires anymore.”As the number of wildfires in California increases, regulators and utilities are looking to new technologies that will help inform cost-effective grid investments. With Gridware’s solution, Barat claims that utilities can not only reduce their risk of sparking a fire, but also demonstrate that risk reduction to regulators through comprehensive asset health profiles.Gridware has partnered with a Western utility to test its new technology and establish a proof of concept. Early results show that the technology can detect pole rot and decay with 83 percent accuracy. The company plans to use its new CalSEED funding to build out its hardware as well as the firmware to support its machine-learning and analytics system.ToloThomas Karagianes and his business partner Iain McClatchie, who previously worked as\xa0technology lead for Google Street View cameras, founded Tolo\xa0to help address the mountain pine beetle problem ravaging forests in the West. The idea was to build a high-resolution camera that could spot signs of beetle infestations from the air and notify the U.S. Forest Service of where the hotspots were. Flash forward five years, and while the camera is still central to Tolo’s business model, the use case has evolved to focus on remote inspection for utility assets.\n\nA relative of Karagianes\' lived in Paradise, Calif.\xa0and lost her home to the deadly wildfire there in 2018. The Camp fire was caused by a broken, century-old C-hook intended to keep high-voltage transmission wires separate from the tower. The breakage that led to the destruction of an entire town was only about an inch wide. A failure like that, according to Karagianes, is difficult for an infrastructure inspector to see from the ground.Tolo’s custom-built camera deployed on a plane or a drone, coupled with the startup’s patent-pending Parallax Imagery software platform, allows inspectors to identify risks to electrical infrastructure that inspectors may miss in the field.\xa0Utilities have tried using cameras on drones and other aircraft to help identify issues on the grid, but Karagianes says the images are difficult to assess unless users also have a sophisticated photo management program that can sift through the files and flag problem areas. Another drawback of conventional imagery analysis is that users can’t get a full, detailed look at what they’re trying to examine.Tolo’s system overcomes these issues by using machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to give clients insights into the status and reliability of their asset. The company\'s Parallax Imagery software also enables users to inspect objects as if they were in the field. By stitching images together, the system can give clients full maneuverability around an asset as well as the ability to zoom in on details.""Traditional wildfire-fighting techniques work well,\xa0up to a point. A whole host of factors, including climate change, have spawned much larger, hotter and more dangerous fires that traditional techniques can’t address,"" said Karagianes. ""The best way to address fires at that scale is to prevent them ever starting. Most of the innovations we see on the technology side today share this focus on prevention, rather than reaction.""The CalSEED funding will help Tolo test its remote inspection platform for utility assets in the field and add new features to its technology, such as the ability to measure real-world distances within Tolo’s software application. In addition to this work with utilities, Tolo is developing a pilot program with CalFire and other local fire departments to perform remote defensible-space assessments that give property owners more information on how to protect their homes from fires.“The basic idea is if you do preventative maintenance it’s a whole lot cheaper than doing the after work. Having good intelligence tells you what to fix,” said Karagianes. “It’s like the old saying: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”ALD Technical SolutionsSan Diego-based startup ALD Technical Solutions has developed an advanced composite technology dubbed a Composite Wire Wrap that’s designed to mechanically reinforce existing aluminum conductor steel-reinforced (ACSR) cables. Adding composite material, such as carbon fiber, to high-voltage transmission lines allows for increased power capacity, which means that utilities can transmit more renewable energy to customers during high-demand hours, said founder Davoud Zamani. These advanced materials also prevent sagging caused by increased power capacity on a line, which can cause wildfires.“If you increase the power...[and] the current, you\'re going to create heat. This heat is going to cause a kind of thermal expansion of aluminum and also steel, and the steel is going to sag,” said Zamani. “We cannot go above 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees\xa0Fahrenheit) because we have a limitation for the steel and aluminum. But with our advanced composite material, we can go up to 500 [degrees] Fahrenheit\xa0or around 250 degrees Celsius.”Overheated cables start to sag over time\xa0and can sway in the wind and hit trees, which could spark a fire if not addressed. Building new ACSR transmission lines is expensive and typically requires approval from local and federal authorities. By retrofitting the lines with composite materials,\xa0grid owners have an opportunity to save money and reduce system downtime. ALD Technical Solutions is currently performing qualification testing of its material at a UCLA laboratory.The support from CalSEED will enable the company to complete its qualifying work and take the technology into the field. Zamani said he is already working with two California utilities and hopes to have a customer demonstration project deployed next year.TopolonetTopolonet\xa0has developed a proprietary algorithm named BusID and implemented that algorithm in a software system for real-time, accurate data on the state and topology of the transmission grid.“Every node of the electrical grid is called a bus, so we are giving an ID, an identity, to each single node,” said co-founder Reza Sabzehgar. “It’s like having a Social Security number for every single person;\xa0as soon as you get their ID you can get the whole story of their life. That’s what we\'re doing here with BusID for the grid.”\n\nExisting systems\xa0such as SCADA transfer data from the grid in minutes, whereas Topolonet’s software can react in seconds, saving grid operators valuable time in the event of an abnormality, said Sabzehgar. Fast and accurate data transfer could help utilities avoid deadly grid failures, such as the 2003 Northeast blackout and the 2018 Camp fire. With support from CalSEED, Topolonet plans to complete the engineering design and begin implementation of the company’s first commercial product.inRG SolutionsKerry McBee spent most of his career conducting forensic investigations of power system failures before launching inRG Solutions, which aims to deploy a novel system for continuously evaluating the physical condition of the electric grid. “I have investigated thousands of events on power systems,” said McBee. “And so I started thinking, ‘How could we actually prevent those?’ [I was] looking at it from the opposite end of the way I used to.”The inRG system consists of multiple power line sensors and data collectors located at substations on the transmission grid. The sensor’s infrared camera and neural network are designed to autonomously identify the primary causes of power grid fires, including swinging conductors, broken equipment, a fallen line and vegetation interference. Still in its early stages, inRG Solutions aims to build a prototype with its CalSEED funding.', 'The most notable example is the November 2018 Camp fire in California, caused by a poorly maintained Pacific Gas & Electric power line that ultimately led to the deaths of at least 85 people.

Bigger Turbines, Better Grids: Siemens Gamesa on Planning an Offshore Boom
",12/3/2020,"[""Europe’s offshore wind ambitions have now been quantified. The U.K. and the 27 European Union nations are aiming for a combined 100 gigawatts of operation capacity by 2030.Getting there is achievable, but to really get the most out of offshore wind’s potential, a host of other puzzle pieces need to fall into place. The offshore wind sector itself is only in control of some of these. The wider power sector, regulators and politicians all have a fundamental role to play.From a technology point of view, however, the sector has done the heavy lifting.Larger turbines are a “key enabler” of the ambitions in London and Brussels, according to Martin Gerhardt, head of offshore product portfolios at\xa0Siemens Gamesa. Beyond efficiencies from the sheer scale, fewer turbines per gigawatt also mean\xa0fewer foundations and less cabling.“We can also increase the voltage levels from 33 kilovolts to 66 kilovolts, which reduces the cabling need again, but actually\xa0also reduces transmission losses, meaning we can produce more power,” Gerhardt said in an interview.Another added benefit, often overlooked, is the savings in servicing and operations, he said. A larger turbine doesn’t require additional extra attention, so jumping from 8-megawatt\xa0to 12-megawatt turbines means that there will be\xa0one-third fewer turbines to maintain.Larger turbines supersize the whole supply chainThe flip\xa0side of this scale,\xa0of course, is the knock-on impacts for turbine makers and the rest of the supply chain. Bigger turbines require bigger\xa0installation vessels with bigger cranes, which means\xa0deeper harbors. Larger blades and towers mean more dockside storage space.\n\nThis is one area where public-sector investment could help.\xa0The U.K. government is currently looking to grant up to £70 million ($94 million) to a port facility able to house a significant offshore wind hub.Then there are the costs that come with getting a new generation of turbines off the ground.\xa0This week, Siemens Gamesa secured a €300 million ($365 million) loan from the European Investment Bank. The money will be used for research and development\xa0purposes including “optimizing the various components of a wind turbine, new applications for turbine maintenance and diagnostic services, and computer applications for optimizing processes and energy production, ranging from blockchain to reality virtual and artificial intelligence,” according to a statement from the company.Another technological nut for the sector to crack is floating offshore wind. This week, DNV GL forecast that it will take until\xa02050 for the cost of floating projects to align more or less with where the U.K.’s fixed-bottom projects are now.Gerhardt said the sector needs to refine the design of foundations on offer from the\xa030 competing concepts jostling for development at present. He expects a\xa0system with a smaller structure and mooring lines to eventually win out.But having plenty of seabed space for fixed foundations reduces some of the urgency to develop the floating market. On the fixed front, Gerhardt is\xa0confident that bigger turbines will boost the technology’s value, with savings being directed toward\xa0the more expensive foundation.Jobs versus costAnother issue for politicians to address is balancing\xa0the competing desire for cheaper and cheaper offshore wind power with creating\xa0as many local jobs as possible.Søren Lassen, head of global offshore wind research at Wood Mackenzie,\xa0told GTM this\xa0summer that COVID-19 recovery plans had shifted the focus for a lot of policymakers toward\xa0job creation.\n\nThe revised U.K. contracts-for-difference auctions will require projects over 300 MW to stick to a local supply-chain plan. Failure to deliver enough local benefits will lock projects out of the system. The precise details are still being hammered out.Gerhardt said there is too much focus on manufacturing jobs. As new markets develop, such as Poland and the Baltic nations, the expectation is that new factories will follow. But this may not be\xa0realistic, he warned.\xa0“It works, maybe, for some very large markets. But for the majority, it won't work, and it creates a hurdle,” he said. The end result would be high costs and overcapacity.Gerhardt doesn’t expect Siemens Gamesa to change its European manufacturing footprint before\xa02030, with its existing facilities able to handle the planned growth.On the other hand, there are\xa0plenty of growth opportunities for\xa0service jobs lasting the full lifespan of a plant, as well as a host of other local supply opportunities.Siemens Gamesa operates the largest blade manufacturing facility in the world in Hull, U.K., and Gerhardt said finding the vast number of qualified staff required to operate the factory had been a challenge.\xa0He’d prefer to see governments focusing on spreading new skills so that a trained workforce is in place for the offshore boom.Beyond offshore windOffshore wind is only one cog in the works for the energy transition. A renewables-heavy grid throws up some new challenges. Complementary and enabling technologies are very much on the company’s radar.Siemens Gamesa is developing its own heat-based long-duration storage system,\xa0and on Thursday it began a pilot for islanded green hydrogen systems. Getting 100 GW of offshore wind not just connected\xa0but connected in an efficient manner\xa0means tearing up the rulebook.The European Commission’s offshore wind strategy includes multinational offshore wind grid planning. Greater regulatory flexibility for cross-border energy collaboration is also on the way.Two-thirds of the €800 billion of investment outlined in the commission’s offshore wind strategy is for the grid, a sign\xa0that the challenge is being taken seriously,\xa0said Gerhardt.\xa0Aligning the EU member states on permitting where possible\xa0and streamlining these processes are\xa0core components of the European Commission’s strategy. Coastal nations have been asked to submit maritime spatial plans by the end of March\xa02021. With a provisional screen by the EC, planning concerns around natural habitats and bird species can be avoided early on, rather than requiring further attention and mitigation from developers late into the process.If all these challenges can be adequately resolved, European offshore wind’s ambitions should be achievable, Gerhardt said. To be clear, they may take some time to get going, he added.\xa0“We expect the bulk of these projects (100 GW)\xa0in 2025 and later,”\xa0with permitting the cause of the delay, he said. “As for the supply chain, I think we are in good shape, and we are starting to prepare for the growth.”"", 'Getting there is achievable, but to really get the most out of offshore wind’s potential, a host of other puzzle pieces need to fall into place.

On the fixed front, Gerhardt is\xa0confident that bigger turbines will boost the technology’s value, with savings being directed toward\xa0the more expensive foundation.', 'Another issue for politicians to address is balancing\xa0the competing desire for cheaper and cheaper offshore wind power with creating\xa0as many local jobs as possible.', 'Søren Lassen, head of global offshore wind research at Wood Mackenzie,\xa0told GTM this\xa0summer that COVID-19 recovery plans had shifted the focus for a lot of policymakers toward\xa0job creation.', 'The revised U.K. contracts-for-difference auctions will require projects over 300 MW to stick to a local supply-chain plan. Failure to deliver enough local benefits will lock projects out of the system. The precise details are still being hammered out.', 'Gerhardt said there is too much focus on manufacturing jobs. As new markets develop, such as Poland and the Baltic nations, the expectation is that new factories will follow. But this may not be\xa0realistic, he warned.\xa0', ""“It works, maybe, for some very large markets. But for the majority, it won't work, and it creates a hurdle,” he said.

Wind Turbine Makers Tout Diagnostic Tech in Service Revenue Push
",10/31/2020,"['Growing competition for wind turbine service revenue\xa0is forcing original equipment manufacturers to up their game in another important\xa0service for the equipment they make\xa0—\xa0remote diagnostics.\xa0This month, for example, Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE) revealed that its Model-Based Diagnostics\xa0system has been upgraded to work with machines of any make.The system, which has been in operation since 2011 and uses as many as 500 predictive models to assess the likelihood of component failures, is already analyzing data from around 17,000 onshore and offshore turbines in the SGRE fleet across 44 countries.“We are now creating models for GE, Senvion\xa0or\xa0Vestas turbines, for example,” an SGRE spokesperson said\xa0in an email. “Our objective is to cover more systems with even more advanced models.”\xa0The Model-Based Diagnostics system is an internal tool that SGRE uses to improve the value of its full-service contracts. It works by looking for data signals that have been associated with component failures in the past, anticipating faults and flagging when a part may need to be fixed or swapped out.SGRE estimates the tool has flagged up 50,000 potential failures over the last nine years\xa0and helped the company carry out preventive maintenance to avoid more than a million hours of turbine downtime.\xa0This kind of diagnostic expertise can help solve a major headache for the wind industry. Unforeseen breakdowns\xa0cost\xa0the sector around $8.5 billion a year, according to Wood Mackenzie. They\xa0can also shorten the lifespan of turbines by stressing components not directly related to the failure.\n\n“There\'s a mutual benefit here,” Henrik Pedersen, SGRE’s solution architect for diagnostic intelligence, said in an interview. “We spend a little bit less on doing the service activity for the customer, and the customer gets additional energy production.”The battle for service contractsSGRE believes the Model-Based Diagnostics system could serve to enhance loyalty to the company’s full-service contracts, Pedersen said. And there is no doubt that the need to grow service revenue\xa0is a high-priority concern for most major wind original equipment manufacturers.OEMs are\xa0offering extended service contracts as a way of shoring up revenue\xa0amid ongoing market pressure to create more cost-effective turbines\xa0with lower levelized energy costs.\xa0Although competition in this area is\xa0fierce, recent research shows full-wrap operations and maintenance costs per turbine have risen by more than 12 percent over the last 10 years.However, for now, it remains unclear whether diagnostics systems such as Model-Based Diagnostics can really enhance customer loyalty — or whether they are simply a way for OEMs to cut in-house costs in an increasingly cutthroat market.Large asset owners, such as Enel Green Power of Italy, commonly prefer to take care of operations and maintenance in house.“OEMs’ capacity for remote monitoring does not influence Enel\'s turbine purchase decisions,” said Luigi La Pegna, head of global operations and maintenance at Enel Green Power.\n\n“Our strategy is to perform monitoring internally, leveraging our team\'s technical expertise and digital platforms. Enel\'s ‘digital eyes’ are getting even closer to assets and local employees thanks to new emerging technologies like smart glasses [and] edge computing,” he said in an email.For many, the focus is simply on performance\xa0rather than the tech that delivers it.“If I put myself in the shoes of the buyer of turbines, I am not going to care at all about what technology they are using in order to make sure that I get the availability that I want,” said Jonas Corné, CEO and founder of the asset management software developer Greenbyte, in an interview.“What I would prefer is that I just get an airtight contract that tells me I will get 98 percent energy-based availability — or even better, that I get 98 percent revenue-based availability. If they\'re using machine learning or whatever, that won\'t really matter to me. I would be looking for security.”Independents reluctant to take the remote diagnostic plunge\xa0The access to vast intellectual property, turbine data and computing power that OEMs have should,\xa0in theory, give them a clear edge when it comes to service delivery, said Corné.This does not appear to be the case in practice, though, which is why independent service providers still occupy a significant niche in the market and there is a growing trend for asset owners to bring servicing in-house.“A telling point is that in the United States, several large asset owners rely on the strength of operational practices rather than digital technology,” said Daniel Liu, principal analyst for renewable energy operations and asset management at Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables.“What they are actively signaling is that they do not think there\'s a use case with remote diagnostic systems.”Corné, too, said remote diagnostics are\xa0not a regular topic of conversation with wind farm owners. That’s not to say they might not appreciate tools to improve the profitability of their assets, of course.But the perceived cost-benefit of such tools is low, and unless they are bundled in existing full-service contracts, turbine manufacturers will need to overcome asset owner concerns on cost versus benefit of deploying digital analysis systems for operations and maintenance.""In general, many asset owners are not yet willing to spend capital and refurbish existing fleets with the infrastructure necessary to realize the full benefits of digital analysis,"" said Liu.', 'This month, for example, Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE) revealed that its Model-Based Diagnostics\xa0system has been upgraded to work with machines of any make.', 'The system, which has been in operation since 2011 and uses as many as 500 predictive models to assess the likelihood of component failures, is already analyzing data from around 17,000 onshore and offshore turbines in the SGRE fleet across 44 countries.', '“We are now creating models for GE, Senvion\xa0or\xa0Vestas turbines, for example,” an SGRE spokesperson said\xa0in an email. “Our objective is to cover more systems with even more advanced models.”\xa0', 'The Model-Based Diagnostics system is an internal tool that SGRE uses to improve the value of its full-service contracts.

Array Technologies Shares Surge After First Big US Solar IPO of 2020
",10/15/2020,"[""Array Technologies, a New Mexico-based maker of solar tracking systems, launched onto the Nasdaq Global Market on Thursday, capping one of the biggest U.S. renewable energy IPOs of recent years.In listing its shares publicly, Array is riding two trends: growing demand for equipment that allows solar projects to squeeze out more power\xa0and strong demand for clean energy stocks ahead of November’s presidential election.Even with an upsized IPO pricing shares at $22, Array surged after hitting the market under ticker symbol ARRY.\xa0The shares soared\xa0more than 65\xa0percent by Thursday afternoon, to above\xa0$36, giving the company a market capitalization of more than $4.6\xa0billion.Array itself sold 7 million shares of common stock in the IPO, raising $154 million —\xa0more than previously expected. Oaktree Capital, the investment manager that bought a majority stake in 2016, sold another 40.5 million shares.Utility-scale solar is now at cost parity with new natural-gas generation in places, CEO Jim Fusaro said in an interview Thursday. “As we continue to scale and grow with the overall market, we’re at a point now where having access to capital will...allow us to invest in our technologies [and]\xa0pay down debt.”The money raised in the IPO is “a permanent source of capital, which will allow us to enable the growth and the value that we bring to our customers. And in many ways, it serves as an attraction to talent,” Fusaro said.Knocking soft costs out of solar projectsArray is no newcomer to the solar industry: The company was founded in 1989 by Ron Corio, a pioneer of solar trackers. Oaktree and Corio will continue to own more than half of the company’s voting power.\n\nToday, Array is the world’s second-largest supplier of solar tracking systems, a growing market expected to be worth\xa0around $3 billion in 2020, according to Wood Mackenzie.Array controlled a 17 percent share of the global market last year, trailing only market leader Nextracker’s 30 percent share, said Molly Cox, a solar analyst at Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables.Array’s main product is its DuraTrack system, which rotates PV panels across a single north-south axis throughout the day to follow the sun. Trackers add upfront costs to a solar project but allow panels to generate more energy compared to a “fixed-tilt” mounting system. Over the course of a project’s lifetime, that results in a substantially lower levelized cost of energy.Other leading tracker manufacturers include Spain-based Soltec and China’s Arctech Solar.As hardware costs continue to fall across the solar industry, greater attention is being placed on soft costs such as customer acquisition and labor, said Cox.Earlier this year, Array announced a new clamp technology —\xa0developed in collaboration with First Solar —\xa0that it says greatly reduces the time it takes to fasten a solar panel onto its trackers. Array is also investing in machine learning for its trackers.Innovations like those are “the wave of the future,” Cox said. “It will be interesting to see how tracker vendors continue to evolve their products to further help installers.”\n\nArray counts\xa0renewable energy construction firms, like Blattner Energy, and developers, like EDF Renewables and Lightsource BP, among its major customers.International market for solar trackers grows upInternational markets represent an increasingly important opportunity for tracker suppliers. Roughly 70 percent of new utility-scale solar projects in the U.S. now come with a tracker, compared to just 30 percent of projects around\xa0the world.Solar markets in developing economies like India remain more focused on the initial upfront cost of\xa0projects, with less focus on the levelized cost of energy, Cox said.
